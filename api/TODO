(Yeah, I know I should have used Jira for this)

HIGH PRIORITY

... login and get token on every e2e test
... get userId from request headers, not from route

- review validators very conception

MID PRIORITY

- make db functions and controllers return objects propperly

LOW PRIORITY

- comments CRUD
- decent e2e tests structure
